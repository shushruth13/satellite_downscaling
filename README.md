# gdg-hackathon - Enhanced NO2 Air Quality Analysis Dashboard
Downscaling of Satellite based air quality map using AI/ML

## üåü Enhanced Features 
Our solution offers a comprehensive approach to NO2 air quality analysis with these advanced capabilities:

1. **AI-Powered Downscaling**: Uses an ensemble model combining RandomForest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks to generate high-resolution NO2 maps from coarse satellite data.

2. **Time Series Forecasting**: Predicts future NO2 levels for the next 30 days, helping plan outdoor activities and inform policy decisions.

3. **Multi-City Comparison**: Compare air quality across different cities with interactive maps and visualizations.

4. **Health Impact Analysis**: Translates NO2 levels into health impacts and provides practical advice for different air quality conditions.

5. **Seasonal Analysis**: Identifies patterns in air quality across different seasons to understand when pollution is at its worst.

6. **Location-Specific Recommendations**: Generates tailored recommendations for reducing NO2 pollution based on city-specific characteristics.

7. **Correlation Analysis**: Identifies the relationship between NO2 levels and factors like population density, traffic, and green cover.

## üìö Original Description

Develop an AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning) model to generate fine spatial resolution air quality map from coarse resolution satellite data. It should utilise existing python-based ML libraries. Developed model need to be validated with unseen independent data. 

Challenge: 
- To utilise large satellite data having gaps under cloudy conditions 
- To select suitable ML algorithm and ensure optimal fitting of ML model for desired accuracy 
- To validate model output with unseen independent data 

Usage: To enhance air quality knowledge, Sharpen focus at local level 

Users: Researchers and government bodies monitoring/working on air quality assessment 

Available Solutions (if Yes, reasons for not using them): Individual components are available, comprehensive and proven solution does not exist. 

Desired Outcome: Fine resolution air quality map of NO2

Machine learning algorithm 
Generally, Random Forest, XGBoost and Neural Network (ANN/CNN) are good for downscaling. However, students may explore different AI/ML algorithms and can decide themselves which algorithm to be used.
